"A dashboard to visualize IOCs from threat intelligence feeds like AlienVault OTX and VirusTotal"


"Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard." This project was developed with the aim of integrating real-time threat intelligence into a user-friendly and informative platform. Built using Python and Streamlit, this dashboard fetches and displays high-confidence malicious IP addresses by leveraging the AbuseIPDB API—a widely trusted, community-driven platform that collects and shares reports of IPs involved in malicious activities such as spam, botnets, and brute-force attacks.

The core functionality of the application revolves around extracting the top 10 most dangerous IP addresses with a confidence score of 90% or higher, and presenting them to the user in a clean, interactive interface. The dashboard is designed to help users—especially security analysts, researchers, and students—monitor critical Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) without the need for complex setups. A custom background image and clean layout enhance the user experience, making the dashboard not only informative but also visually engaging.

From a technical perspective, this project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, RESTful API consumption, data parsing using the requests library, modular code organization, and front-end development using Streamlit. The implementation showcases my understanding of real-world cybersecurity applications, and how to build tools that bridge the gap between raw threat data and practical visibility. This project also reflects my ability to work with live external data sources and turn them into actionable intelligence through automation and intuitive design.

Overall, the Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard is a lightweight, scalable, and practical tool that highlights both my technical competencies and my awareness of contemporary cybersecurity threats. It serves not only as a demonstration of my coding and analytical skills but also as a project with real-world applicability in today’s threat landscape.
